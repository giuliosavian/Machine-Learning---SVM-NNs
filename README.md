## Intro Of The Project
This project has been made by myself from the machine learning course in the university of Padua.

Non linear models for classification

We are going to touch: 
1. SVM for image classification (MNIST dataset)
2. Neural Networks for image classification (MNIST dataset)
3. Compare and discuss: SVM vs NNs

<!-- Get started -->
## Get Started
